### Hi there! My name is Krzysiek 🤗🤙

I am 27-years-old guy from Poland, and I am dreaming of becoming a fullstack .NET developer in the future. 
Currently I am hard working upon my programming skills 📚💪. It's nice to see you on my GitHub profile!


### 🔍 Overview
I am aspiring .NET developer and I am hard working upon my programming skills. I have strong analytical and problem-solving skills with a great desire to learn new things everyday. I also have very good soft skills and some experience in team work, which I have gained during performing a Business Analyst-like role upon the project. I have also had occasion to develop some solutions using VBA and Google Apps Script technologies, which made me fall in love with programming 😍!

### 💻 My Current technology stack
* C#
* .NET Core (WPF)
* SQL (SQLite)

### 📚 Incoming on my Learning Path
* HTML/ CSS/ JS (Type Script, Angular, React, VueJS)
* Unit Testing (xUnit) 
* ASP.NET 

and there are many, many more items to learn, but these are the ones that I will be focusing in the nearest future ✌️
